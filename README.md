# VBA-challenge

We will create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

1 - The ticker symbol

2 - Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

3 - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The total stock volume of the stock. 
4 - We will add functionality to our script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"
